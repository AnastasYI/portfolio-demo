So this is my portfolio...

I tried doing something that doesn't require a lot of media queries for mobile apps. I kept it simple and used mostly % or em for sizing. The only flex-direction I changed was in my Services section which is hosting the logo component were the changed was made. I also used a carousel component in my for now empty projects section.

I tried to keep everything simple color wise and not overflow my App with a lot of text or complicated features

Things that I want to change are the font size for my mobile App and andd some more complexity to the navBar. The navBar is for now always on top but I wish to update it to be more responsive on mobileApp.
